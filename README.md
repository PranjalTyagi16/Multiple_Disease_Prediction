Multiple Disease Prediction System utilizes machine learning techniques to predict health conditions including diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and breast cancer.
Implemented machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) for diabetes prediction, Logistic Regression for heart disease prediction, and tailored models for Parkinson's disease and breast cancer, achieving high accuracy rates.
Designed and implemented an interactive and user-friendly Streamlit-based interface enabling users to input health data effortlessly and obtain instant predictions, enhancing accessibility and usability.
